    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrated six key concepts in probability and statistics:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Basic Probability**: Simulated coin tosses and dice rolls to verify theoretical probabilities through experimentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Multiple Trials**: Calculated the probability of getting at least one \"6\" in 10 die rolls, showing how probabilities compound over multiple events.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Conditional Probability**: Explored conditional probabilities with ball drawings and verified that with replacement, events are independent.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Discrete Random Variables**: Generated samples from a discrete distribution and computed empirical statistics that match theoretical values.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Continuous Distributions**: Visualized the exponential distribution and showed how empirical data matches the theoretical PDF.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Central Limit Theorem**: Demonstrated one of the most important theorems in statistics - that sample means tend toward a normal distribution regardless of the original distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each problem combined simulation, statistical computation, and visualization to build intuition about probability concepts."
